    <div id="boxAboutMe">
      <p>Hi there! I'm Allie <i><small>(they/them)</i></small>.</p>
      <p>I am a mechanical engineer by training with 5+ years 
        of professional experience in the consumer hardware industry. I am accomplished in driving 
        projects from concept to shelf, and get jazzed about trying to find the most elegant solution 
        to complex problems. While working as a mechanical design engineer I got a taste of coding
        through programing Arduinos for robotics and I quickly found myself taking online courses in
        software engineering and volunteering for all software related projects at work. As of Oct. 2022 I
        took an exciting leap into the next stage of my career by commiting to a software intensive bootcamp
        with Flatiron School in NYC.</p>
      <p>I grew up in New Hampshire and went to college at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. While in school 
        I moved around every 6 months through the co-op program where I lived and worked in 
        Rome, Italy; Manchester, VT; Vancouver, CA; Woodinville, WA; and the Bay Area. Since graduating I spent a
        stint in NYC, and am currently residing in Upstate, NY with my fiance while he attends medical school.</p>

      <p><strong>HIKING</strong></p>
      <p>My absolute favorite pass-times are hiking and backpacking. During peak season you can catch me on trail at least 3 days a week.</p>
      <p>I'm currently working on a few hiking challenges with my best friend, and can't wait to add more challenges to the list!</p>

      <p><strong>WOOD WORKING</strong></p>
      <p>My fiance and I recently got into wood working and quickly became hooked. The combination of artistry, mechanics, and problem solving is such a good brain scratch.</p>
      <p>Below you can see images of a TV concole, table, and end-grain cutting board that I made.</p>
